# ECE_1000_Automatic_Plant_Watering_System
  It can be difficult to give plants the right amount of water necessary to grow. With an automatic plant watering system, plants will  not only be able to receive the perfect amount of water, but will also decrease the amount of wasted water. This project is significant because it is motivated behind the environmental challenge in IEEE. With a more precise watering system, plants will be able to flourish while not wasting water. It is crucial to implement systems similar to this project, especially in locations where water is more difficult to obtain. This project was developed by Summer Morris and Isaiah Short, both of which are Electrical Engineering majors. To begin the project, research is necessary in order to fully understand the project.
